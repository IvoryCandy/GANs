[Generative Adversarial Network](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) is a generative model that contains a discriminator and a generator. 
The discriminator is a binary classifier that is trained to classify the real image as real and the fake image as fake. 
The discriminator is trained to assign 1 to the real image and 0 to the fake image. 
The generator is a generative model that creates an image from the latent code. 
The generator is trained to generate an image that can not be distinguishable from the real image in order to deceive the discriminator.
